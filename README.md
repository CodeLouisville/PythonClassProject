# Week 5 Challenge Code Louisville 2017 Python/Django Cohort
Basic Django Project for the Fall 2017 Python Cohort serving the site from FEWD and extending functionality. louie\_pizza contains the full Django project.

For the original FEWD project see https://github.com/CodeLouisville/May2017-FEWD-Class-Project

# Challenge
The site is setup and providing content to users. But currently we don't have anyway for Louies Pizza patrons to get updates on our newest pies, deals and drinks. Using Django Forms let's make sure customers can subscribe to our newsletter for regular updates, and let's also make sure they can unsubscribe in case they move.
